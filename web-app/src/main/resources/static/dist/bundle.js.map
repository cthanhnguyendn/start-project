You would typically create a\n\t * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\n\t * is used to wrap several different methods. Wrappers are extremely simple -\n\t * they only require implementing two methods.\n\t *\n\t * <pre>\n\t *                       wrappers (injected at creation time)\n\t *                                      +        +\n\t *                                      |        |\n\t *                    +-----------------|--------|--------------+\n\t *                    |                 v        |              |\n\t *                    |      +---------------+   |              |\n\t *                    |   +--|    wrapper1   |---|----+         |\n\t *                    |   |  +---------------+   v    |         |\n\t *                    |   |          +-------------+  |         |\n\t *                    |   |     +----|   wrapper2  |--------+   |\n\t *                    |   |     |    +-------------+  |     |   |\n\t *                    |   |     |                     |     |   |\n\t *                    |   v     v                     v     v   | wrapper\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ | invariants\n\t * perform(anyMethod) | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | | maintained\n\t * +----------------->|-|---|-|---|-->|anyMethod|---|---|-|---|-|-------->\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ |\n\t *                    |  initialize                    close    |\n\t *                    +-----------------------------------------+\n\t * </pre>\n\t *\n\t * Use cases:\n\t * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.\n\t *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.\n\t * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,\n\t *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.\n\t * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a\n\t *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.\n\t * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new\n\t *   content.\n\t * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue\n\t *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).\n\t * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.\n\t *\n\t * Transactional plugin API:\n\t * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.\n\t * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked\n\t *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.\n\t *\n\t * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules\n\t * that implement `initialize` and `close`.\n\t * @return {Transaction} Single transaction for reuse in thread.\n\t *\n\t * @class Transaction\n\t */\n\tvar Mixin = {\n\t  /**\n\t   * Sets up this instance so that it is prepared for collecting metrics.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

See the test for more.\n  // See also:\n  // https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/41aa3496aa632634f650edbe10d617799922d265/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L853\n  if (reactMixin.mixins) {\n    reactMixin.mixins.reverse().forEach(mixinClass.bind(null, reactClass));\n  }\n\n  return reactClass;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = (function() {\n  var reactMixin = mixinProto;\n\n  reactMixin.onClass = function(reactClass, mixin) {\n    return mixinClass(reactClass, mixin);\n  };\n\n  reactMixin.decorate = function(mixin) {\n    return function(reactClass) {\n      return reactMixin.onClass(reactClass, mixin);\n    };\n  };\n\n  return reactMixin;\n})();\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/redux-devtools-log-monitor/~/react-json-tree/~/react-mixin/index.js\n ** module id = 270\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\n\nvar _instrument = require('./instrument');\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'instrument', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _instrument.default;\n  }\n});\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'ActionCreators', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _instrument.ActionCreators;\n  }\n});\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'ActionTypes', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _instrument.ActionTypes;\n  }\n});\n\nvar _persistState = require('./persistState');\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'persistState', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _persistState.default;\n  }\n});\n\nvar _createDevTools = require('./createDevTools');\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'createDevTools', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _createDevTools.default;\n  }\n});\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/redux-devtools/lib/index.js\n ** module id = 271\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nvar _typeof = typeof Symbol === \"function\" && typeof Symbol.iterator === \"symbol\" ? function (obj) { return typeof obj; } : function (obj) { return obj && typeof Symbol === \"function\" && obj.constructor === Symbol ? \"symbol\" : typeof obj; };\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\nexports.ActionCreators = exports.ActionTypes = undefined;\nexports.default = instrument;\n\nvar _difference = require('lodash/difference');\n\nvar _difference2 = _interopRequireDefault(_difference);\n\nvar _union = require('lodash/union');\n\nvar _union2 = _interopRequireDefault(_union);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\nvar ActionTypes = exports.ActionTypes = {\n  PERFORM_ACTION: 'PERFORM_ACTION',\n  RESET: 'RESET',\n  ROLLBACK: 'ROLLBACK',\n  COMMIT: 'COMMIT',\n  SWEEP: 'SWEEP',\n  TOGGLE_ACTION: 'TOGGLE_ACTION',\n  SET_ACTIONS_ACTIVE: 'SET_ACTIONS_ACTIVE',\n  JUMP_TO_STATE: 'JUMP_TO_STATE',\n  IMPORT_STATE: 'IMPORT_STATE'\n};\n\n/**\n * Action creators to change the History state.\n */\nvar ActionCreators = exports.ActionCreators = {\n  performAction: function performAction(action) {\n    if (typeof action.type === 'undefined') {\n      throw new Error('Actions may not have an undefined \"type\" property.
