This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

In React, a fresh constructor is created, then all mixins are mixed in recursively,\n  // then the actual spec is mixed in last.\n  //\n  // With ES6 classes, the properties are already there, so smart-mixin mixes functions (a, b) -> b()a(), which is\n  // the opposite of how React does it. If we reverse this array, we basically do the whole logic in reverse,\n  // which makes the result the same. See the test for more.\n  // See also:\n  // https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/41aa3496aa632634f650edbe10d617799922d265/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L853\n  if (reactMixin.mixins) {\n    reactMixin.mixins.reverse().forEach(mixinClass.bind(null, reactClass));\n  }\n\n  return reactClass;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = (function() {\n  var reactMixin = mixinProto;\n\n  reactMixin.onClass = function(reactClass, mixin) {\n    return mixinClass(reactClass, mixin);\n  };\n\n  reactMixin.decorate = function(mixin) {\n    return function(reactClass) {\n      return reactMixin.onClass(reactClass, mixin);\n    };\n  };\n\n  return reactMixin;\n})();\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/redux-devtools-log-monitor/~/react-json-tree/~/react-mixin/index.js\n ** module id = 270\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\n\nvar _instrument = require('./instrument');\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'instrument', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _instrument.default;\n  }\n});\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'ActionCreators', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _instrument.ActionCreators;\n  }\n});\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'ActionTypes', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _instrument.ActionTypes;\n  }\n});\n\nvar _persistState = require('./persistState');\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'persistState', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _persistState.default;\n  }\n});\n\nvar _createDevTools = require('./createDevTools');\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, 'createDevTools', {\n  enumerable: true,\n  get: function get() {\n    return _createDevTools.default;\n  }\n});\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/redux-devtools/lib/index.js\n ** module id = 271\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nvar _typeof = typeof Symbol === \"function\" && typeof Symbol.iterator === \"symbol\" ? function (obj) { return typeof obj; } : function (obj) { return obj && typeof Symbol === \"function\" && obj.constructor === Symbol ? \"symbol\" : typeof obj; };\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\nexports.ActionCreators = exports.ActionTypes = undefined;\nexports.default = instrument;\n\nvar _difference = require('lodash/difference');\n\nvar _difference2 = _interopRequireDefault(_difference);\n\nvar _union = require('lodash/union');\n\nvar _union2 = _interopRequireDefault(_union);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\nvar ActionTypes = exports.ActionTypes = {\n  PERFORM_ACTION: 'PERFORM_ACTION',\n  RESET: 'RESET',\n  ROLLBACK: 'ROLLBACK',\n  COMMIT: 'COMMIT',\n  SWEEP: 'SWEEP',\n  TOGGLE_ACTION: 'TOGGLE_ACTION',\n  SET_ACTIONS_ACTIVE: 'SET_ACTIONS_ACTIVE',\n  JUMP_TO_STATE: 'JUMP_TO_STATE',\n  IMPORT_STATE: 'IMPORT_STATE'\n};\n\n/**\n * Action creators to change the History state.\n */\nvar ActionCreators = exports.ActionCreators = {\n  performAction: function performAction(action) {\n    if (typeof action.type === 'undefined') {\n      throw new Error('Actions may not have an undefined \"type\" property.
